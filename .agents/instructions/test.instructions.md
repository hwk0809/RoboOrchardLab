# Test Instructions

## Test Design

- Follow the style of nearby tests before introducing a new pattern.
- Prefer the smallest test that proves the target behavior.
- Use real fixtures, datasets, models, and file paths when the test is intended to validate actual integration behavior.
- Do not replace required real test inputs with fallback skip logic when the test is expected to prove correctness in the configured environment.
- When a test depends on an external binary, codec, or other runtime
  capability that is not a documented repository-baseline requirement, probe
  that capability in the test and skip when unavailable instead of making
  the default test phase fail for environment reasons.
- Use mocks or monkeypatch only when the test target is isolated assembly logic and real dependencies are not part of the behavior under test.
- For process-backed or external-binary integrations, prefer one real
  integration path that proves the happy path against the actual dependency
  and separate narrow fake or monkeypatched tests for failure paths that are
  difficult to trigger reliably with the real backend.
- For processor, envelope, compose, or `pre_process`/`post_process` contract tests, follow `.agents/references/processor-guideline.md`.
- When adding a new `EnvelopeIOProcessor` or any new processor or adapter that reads or writes `processor_context`, add tests for the contract it relies on, including whether it returns fresh context objects or intentionally shares references.
- When deprecating or removing a processor or inference hook seam, test the canonical path and make the legacy seam's status explicit.
- If a deprecated compatibility entrypoint remains supported, test it directly.
- If the legacy seam is unsupported and ignored, test the warning and non-dispatch behavior instead, and do not describe it as direct-call compatibility.
- When a wrapper or adapter exposes both raw data and derived data for the
  same contract, test both the assembly logic and at least one end-to-end
  consistency path between the raw and derived representations.
- For frame or transform adapters, prefer one narrow unit test that checks the
  naming and graph assembly rules and one integration-style test that checks
  numerical consistency against the real runtime source.
- For Pydantic config, ref, or other caller-facing validation surfaces,
  do not rely only on direct Python construction in tests.
- Prefer covering direct construction, `model_validate(...)`, and a JSON
  round-trip when compatibility aliases, coercion, or serialized loading
  behavior matter.
- If branch selection depends on Pydantic coercion, include at least one
  validation-path test that proves the coerced semantics match the runtime
  branch taken.
- When one config field or kwargs surface fans out to multiple downstream
  APIs with different accepted arguments, add at least one focused negative
  test for an invalid cross-branch combination.
- Prefer failing at the repository-owned boundary with a readable error
  instead of relying on a deep dependency stack trace as the first signal.
- For `PolicyEvaluator` or `PolicyEvaluatorRemote` changes, keep the minimum
  matrix explicit:
  - local and remote parity for the public evaluator surface
  - configuration-boundary validation for contracts or metric capabilities
  - timeout, worker-lost, busy, and recreate behavior for remote wrappers
  - recoverable policy or metric runtime-state restore after recreate when
    the feature depends on cross-episode state
  - higher-level orchestration partial-failure coverage when a failed episode
    could leave mutated metric state behind
  - at least one integration-style test when script-level orchestration such
    as RobotWin evaluation depends on the changed evaluator contract
- For benchmark evaluator or backend changes, follow
  `.agents/references/benchmark-evaluator-guideline.md`; keep fast tests fake
  by default and reserve real simulator runs for explicit integration or
  manual validation unless the task directly targets simulator integration.

## Fixtures

- Keep reusable fixtures in the nearest `conftest.py` that matches their sharing scope.
- Move shared model paths, tokenizer paths, processor paths, and other reusable test resources out of individual test files when multiple tests in the same directory can reuse them.
- Keep test-specific fixtures in the test module when they are only used by one file.

## Test Structure

- Match the local project convention for test organization; prefer class-based tests when nearby files use `Test...` classes.
- Keep assertions focused on the behavior under test instead of asserting incidental implementation details.
- When a test is meant to help inspect real returned data, print or otherwise expose the key returned values in the test run so failures and manual verification are easier to interpret.

## Validation

- Before running `python`, `pytest`, or `ruff`, load `.agents/instructions/environment.instructions.md`.
- Run the narrowest relevant `pytest` target for the changed test or module first.
- For small or focused local validation, prefer serial pytest runs. When the
  pytest scope is broad enough that parallelism will materially reduce
  turnaround time, prefer the repository's canonical test entrypoints or an
  explicit worker count that fits the target instead of `-n auto`.
- When running repository tests, disable `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, and `https_proxy` unless the task explicitly requires proxy access.
- For tests that spawn `accelerate launch`, `torchrun`, or similar
  distributed subprocesses under xdist, do not use a probe-and-release
  free-port helper. Prefer port `0` or another launcher-owned atomic port
  allocation path.
- If a launcher implements port `0` as probe-and-release internally, use
  per-worker stable port candidates and retry only after a real
  `EADDRINUSE` launch failure.
- If a subprocess helper does not need child-process coverage, clear
  inherited `COV_CORE_*` and `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` variables before
  launch so pytest-cov noise does not mask the real failure.
- When full-test targets change into `build/test`, set an explicit checkout
  import path such as `PYTHONPATH="$PWD"` so validation does not import an
  installed or sibling checkout by accident.
- When validating with an alternate dependency environment, prefer explicit
  interpreter entrypoints such as `RUN="<env>/bin/python -m"` or
  `<env>/bin/python -m pytest` over relying on console scripts that may come
  from another environment.
- Run `ruff check` on modified test files.
- If the local pytest environment requires temporary flags or environment variables to run successfully, document the exact command used and why it was needed.
