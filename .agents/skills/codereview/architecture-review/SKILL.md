name: architecture-review
description: Review local code, diffs, modules, directories, or design changes for consequential architecture issues when the user explicitly asks for architecture review, when an upstream review routes architecture-sensitive scope here, or when the current review/evaluation request is primarily architectural.
---
Provide an architecture review for the given local target.

Use this skill after `.agents/skills/codereview/SKILL.md` routes the task
here. Read `../references/triggering-and-signal.md` first.

Do not use this skill for ordinary PR/MR bug review when architecture is not
the main or clearly material question. Use `../prmr-codereview/SKILL.md` for
that flow. Do not use this skill for routine implementation self-checks or
casual cleanup opinions.

**Agent assumptions (applies to all agents and subagents):**
- All tools are functional and will work without error. Do not test tools or
  make exploratory calls. Make sure this is clear to every subagent that is
  launched.
- Only call a tool if it is required to complete the task. Every tool call
  should have a clear purpose.
- Choose subagents by capability tier rather than vendor-specific model
  names: use a lightweight reviewer for scope discovery, a general reviewer
  for structural summaries, and the strongest available reviewer for issue
  finding or validation.
- This workflow requires subagents. Do not silently collapse it into a
  single-agent review. If delegation is unavailable or not yet authorized,
  stop and ask for explicit delegation permission before proceeding.
- Keep the active architecture-review wave bounded. Close completed
  structural-summary, reviewer, and validator agents as soon as their outputs
  have been incorporated before launching later phases.
- The reviewer counts and validation pass described below are mandatory for
  this workflow. Do not silently launch fewer subagents or merge distinct
  reviewer roles into one agent.

To do this, follow these steps precisely:

1. Determine the review target and scope.
   - Identify whether the review target is a local directory, file set, git
     diff, branch diff, or design-oriented change.
   - Identify the paths that actually belong to the requested review scope.
   - If the request is ambiguous, choose the smallest reasonable scope that
     satisfies the request.

2. Gather only the in-scope guidance.
   - Load the root `AGENTS.md` file, if it exists.
   - Load any directory-scoped `AGENTS.md` files that apply to the target.
   - Load the in-scope `.agents/instructions/`, `.agents/references/`, and
     `.agents/skills/` files referenced by those `AGENTS.md` files.
   - Always include `.agents/references/architecture-review-guideline.md`
     when it is in scope.
   - If an applicable package-local supplement exists, load that supplement
     only after the root architecture baseline.

3. Produce a concise structural summary before finding issues.
   - Summarize the main layers, contracts, and caller-facing boundaries in
     the target.
   - State which architecture dimensions are materially relevant to this
     review.

4. Launch 3 reviewers in parallel.
   - Reviewer 1: boundary and ownership reviewer
   - Reviewer 2: contract and compatibility reviewer
   - Reviewer 3: abstraction and evolvability reviewer

   Each reviewer should return only issues with:
   - a concrete architectural problem
   - clear impact on maintainability, compatibility, extension cost, or
     correctness boundary
   - enough evidence to validate the issue from the reviewed scope
   Close these reviewers once the candidate-issue set has been consolidated.

5. Validate each proposed issue.
   - Launch validation reviewers in small batches for candidate issues.
   - Validate that the issue is real within the stated scope and that the
     claimed impact is concrete.
   - Validate any cited `AGENTS.md` / `.agents` guidance rule is actually in
     scope for the affected files.
   - Close each validator as soon as its assigned validations have been
     incorporated.

6. Filter and de-duplicate.
   - Remove unvalidated issues.
   - Merge overlapping issues across reviewers.
   - Keep only high-signal findings.

7. Output a report using `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`.
   - State the reviewed scope and the architecture dimensions actually
     reviewed.
   - If no issues were found, use the exact text:
     `No issues found. Checked the reviewed architecture dimensions.`
